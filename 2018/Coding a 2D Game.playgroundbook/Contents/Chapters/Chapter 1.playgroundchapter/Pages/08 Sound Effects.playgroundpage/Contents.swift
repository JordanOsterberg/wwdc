 # Sound Effects
 Our game is complete, but we can spice it up with some sound effects. Let's play some sound effects when different events occur!
 
 ðŸ”ˆ Make sure you turn up your volume and enable alert sounds from Control Center for the full experience!
 
 ## Parameters
 
 To do this, we need to learn about function parameters. Previously, we've learned about functions that do just one function with no parameters. Adding parameters to functions can allow functions to provide different functions for different parmaters.
 
 Using parameters is easy: Just call the function like normal, and inside the parathenses type the value you want to use.. Playing sounds is easy with parameters, just use: `playSound(.ding)`
 
 The sound can be `.ding`, `.meow`, and `.groan`.
 
 > The first sound is already done for you, inside of `catTouchedFish`.
 
 * callout(Goal:):
 1. Inside of the `gameWin` function, play the `.meow` sound
 2. Inside of the `gameLose` function, play the `.groan` sound
 3. Inside of the `catTouchedCheckpoint` the `.ding`
