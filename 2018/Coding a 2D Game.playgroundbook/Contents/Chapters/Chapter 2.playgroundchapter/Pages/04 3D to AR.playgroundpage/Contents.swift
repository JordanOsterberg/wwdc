 # 3D to AR
 
 Like you saw towards the end of Chapter One, AR can be used to enhance our game and provide functionality, such as a map of the entire level-- here's a snippet of the code that powers that functionality. It uses SceneKit to place our Game on an `SCNPlane`, then places that plane into your living room!

plane.firstMaterial?.isDoubleSided = true // Make sure our scene shows up on both sides

let node = SCNNode(geometry: plane) // Create the node
