 # ðŸš™ Vroom Vroom
 Let's add some traffic into our city! Firstly, you'll use the ```addCars``` function to add the cars into our scene.
 
 ðŸ’¡ **Tip**: Find a road to watch the cars vroom by.
 
 Next, you'll change the speed of the cars by changing the ```duration``` of their travel. The ```duration``` is a variable with a value of ```4``` by default. The lower, the faster the cars. The higher, the slower.
 
 ## Goal
 * callout(Goal:):
 1. Use the ```addCars``` function to add the cars into the scene.
 2. Change the ```duration``` of the cars' travel.
 
 When you're ready to test your code, press "Run my code".
