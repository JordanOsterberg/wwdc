 # ðŸŽ§ Let's Get Loud
 We've given Ninja the ability to walk, jump, and find his ticket pieces. He can attend WWDC19 now!
 
 Let's make his journey a bit more... epic! Let's change the background music.
 
 To do this, we need to learn about [variables](glossary://Variable). A variable stores information of a certain type. In this case, we have a variable called ```backgroundMusic```. ```backgroundMusic``` is a ```Music``` variable.
 
 Ninja has made three different tracks that he'd like to listen to. These tracks are represented by ```Music``` variables, which have three possible values: ```.funky```, ```.crazy```, and ```.epic```.
 
 You can change a variable's value by typing the name of the variable, followed by a space, and then the value you would like it to be:
 
 ```
 backgroundMusic = .funky
 ```
 
 ## Goal
 * callout(Goal:):
 1. Change the value of backgroundMusic to be either ```.funky```, ```.crazy```, or ```.epic```.
 
 When you're ready to test your code, press "Run my code".
