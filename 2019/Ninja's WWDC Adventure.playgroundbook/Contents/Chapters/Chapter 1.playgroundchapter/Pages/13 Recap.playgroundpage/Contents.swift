 # ‚è™ Recap
 Awesome! You've helped Ninja make it to WWDC19, and you gave him music, cars, fed Forester the Dog, and made our game Accessible to everyone!
 
 Feel free to play through the game, and explore the city a bit.
 
 Teaching has always been a passion of mine, and I'm incredibly excited to be able to share that passion with you in this Playground.
 
 I hope you enjoyed my WWDC19 Scholarship submission!
