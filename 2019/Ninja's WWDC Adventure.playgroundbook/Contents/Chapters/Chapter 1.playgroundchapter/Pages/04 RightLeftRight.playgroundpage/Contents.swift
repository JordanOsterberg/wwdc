 # âž¡ Right, Left, Right!
 Oh no! ðŸ˜± Shocked by losing his ticket to WWDC, it looks like Ninja has forgotten how to move! Let's give him a hand. ðŸ™Œ
 
 To help Ninja move, we need to learn about [functions](glossary://Function). Functions are little pieces of code that we can use at any time.
 
 Let's take a look at a function:
 
 ```
 func didMoveJoystickLeft() {
    // ðŸ•¸ Not much to see here...
 }
 ```
 
 This function's name is ```didMoveJoystickLeft```.
 
 To use a function, type the name of the function, followed by parentheses: ```functionName()```.
 
 ## Goal
 * callout(Goal:):
 1. Inside of the ```didMoveJoystickLeft``` and the ```didMoveJoystickRight``` functions, we're going to move Ninja. You can move Ninja by using the ```moveNinjaLeft``` and ```moveNinjaRight``` functions.
 
 When you're ready to test your code, go ahead and press "Run my code".
 
 ðŸ’¡ **Tip:** If your code doesn't work, you'll be able to see the solution.
