 # 😸 Here, Kitty!
 Welcome to my WWDC19 Scholarship Playground! You'll be building out the game you see on the right side of the screen, so go ahead and get familiar with it.
 
 🏁 **Goal**: The goal of the game is to get Ninja the Cat to WWDC on time! Unfortunately, Ninja's Scholarship ticket was torn up. Collect the three ticket pieces to make it to the conference.
 
 🕹 **Controls**: The white knob in the bottom left corner is your Joystick. Move it left and right to move Ninja around. If you move it upward, Ninja will jump!
 
 🔊 **Sound**: Make sure to turn your alert sounds on so you can here the music and sound effects!
 
 ♿️ **Accessibility**: I've worked hard to ensure that my Playground is supported by VoiceOver for those who need it!
 
 When you're ready to move on, go ahead and press the big "Run my code" button!
