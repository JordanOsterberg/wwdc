 # ðŸŽŸ Ticketing
 Ninja is able to move now, but where are those ticket pieces? Oh no! ðŸ™Š It looks like they're not in the scene yet.
 
 Let's use two [functions](glossary://Function) to add them in and allow Ninja to collect them.
 
 First, add the tickets to the scene with the ```addTickets``` function.

 Secondly, inside of the ```ninjaFoundTicket``` function, use the ```collectTicket``` function. ```ninjaFoundTicket``` is run whenever Ninja runs into a ticket.
 
 ## Goal
 * callout(Goal:):
 1. Add the tickets to the scene by using the ```addTickets``` function.
 2. Inside of the ```ninjaFoundTicketPiece``` function, use the ```collectTicketPiece``` function.
 
 When you're ready to test your code, press "Run my code".
